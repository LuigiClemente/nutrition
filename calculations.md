### Level 1: Basic Sugar Management and Satiety
At this level, the focus is on managing the user's blood sugar response and keeping them fuller for longer. The app provides simple suggestions to achieve steady energy levels without causing sugar spikes. For example, the app might suggest adding avocado to toast to increase healthy fat intake, which slows down sugar absorption and prolongs satiety.

### Level 2: Gradual Healthy Substitutions
Building on Level 1, this stage involves making incremental changes to replace less healthy foods with healthier alternatives. The app suggests substitutions such as using zucchini noodles instead of pasta or cauliflower rice instead of regular rice. Additionally, it focuses on reducing sugar intake by modifying recipes and progressively introducing healthier ingredients, aiming for sustainable improvements in the userâ€™s diet.

### Level 3: Holistic and Optimal Nutrition

At this stage, the app promotes a diet with very little or no added sugar, emphasizing foods that support optimal gut health, lipid balance, and glucose regulation. The recommendations at this level are based on scientifically proven nutrition strategies, ensuring the best possible outcomes for the user's overall health.

### Level 4: Professional and Goal-Oriented Nutrition
This level is for users with specific health or performance goals. It provides highly tailored nutrition plans that align with the user's objectives, such as weight loss, muscle gain, or improved metabolic health.
