### Level 1: Basic Sugar Management and Satiety
At this level, the focus is on managing the user's blood sugar response and keeping them fuller for longer. The app provides simple suggestions to achieve steady energy levels without causing sugar spikes. For example, the app might suggest adding avocado to toast to increase healthy fat intake, which slows down sugar absorption and prolongs satiety.

### Level 2: Gradual Healthy Substitutions
Building on Level 1, this stage involves making incremental changes to replace less healthy foods with healthier alternatives. The app suggests substitutions such as using zucchini noodles instead of pasta or cauliflower rice instead of regular rice. Additionally, it focuses on reducing sugar intake by modifying recipes and progressively introducing healthier ingredients, aiming for sustainable improvements in the user’s diet.

### Level 3: Holistic and Optimal Nutrition
Level 3 is designed for users seeking a comprehensive approach to nutrition. At this stage, the app promotes a diet with very little or no added sugar, emphasizing foods that support optimal gut health, lipid balance, and glucose regulation. The recommendations at this level are based on scientifically proven nutrition strategies, ensuring the best possible outcomes for the user's overall health.

### Level 4: Professional and Goal-Oriented Nutrition
This level is for users with specific health or performance goals. It provides highly tailored nutrition plans that align with the user's objectives, such as weight loss, muscle gain, or improved metabolic health. The app focuses on achieving the end result as the primary goal, using data-driven recommendations and closely monitoring progress.

To explain the calculation part of the app in the context of the OpenAPI schema you've provided, we'll focus on how the app would compute meal scores based on user information, dietary preferences, health conditions, and other factors as outlined in the schema.

### Calculation Logic for Meal Scoring

The calculation logic is central to tailoring meal recommendations to users based on their unique health data and preferences. Here's how the calculation structure might be implemented:

#### 1. **Collect User Data**

The API endpoints collect comprehensive user data, which serves as input for the meal scoring algorithm. This includes:

- **User Health Information**: Details like age, gender, body metrics, activity levels, and fluid intake.
- **Dietary Preferences**: Specific preferences or dietary restrictions the user may have (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free).
- **Health Conditions**: Any medical conditions that may affect dietary needs (e.g., diabetes, hypertension).
- **Nutritional Deficiencies**: Data on any specific deficiencies the user has that might require tailored nutrition.
- **Food Allergies and Intolerances**: Information on any foods the user should avoid.
- **Microbiome Data**: Data on gut bacteria diversity, which can influence dietary recommendations.
- **Blood Glucose and Lipid Profile Data**: Metrics like average blood glucose levels and lipid profiles that help in recommending heart-healthy or blood-sugar-friendly meals.
- **Environmental Factors**: Location and weather data, which might affect dietary needs or preferences.

#### 2. **Dynamic Filtering of Meals**

Based on the collected user data, the system dynamically filters meal options. For example:

- **Exclude Allergens**: If the user is allergic to peanuts, any meal containing peanuts is automatically excluded.
- **Match Dietary Preferences**: If the user is vegetarian, only vegetarian meals are considered.
- **Health Condition Considerations**: For a user with diabetes, meals with low glycemic index ingredients may be preferred.

#### 3. **Calculate Meal Scores**

The meal scoring algorithm integrates various components of user data to compute a score for each meal. Here’s a simplified outline of how the scoring might work:

- **Nutritional Matching**: Score meals higher if they match the user’s nutritional needs (e.g., a user with low iron may get a higher score for iron-rich meals).
- **Health Goals Alignment**: Increase the score for meals that align with the user's health goals, such as weight loss or muscle gain.
- **Recent Consumption**: If a user has recently consumed a similar meal and prefers variety, reduce the score to avoid repetition.
- **Personalized Nutritional Impact**: Use data from health monitoring (like CGM and lipid profiles) to prioritize meals that support stable glucose levels or improve cholesterol.
- **Microbiome Compatibility**: Increase the score for meals that contain ingredients beneficial for the user’s gut microbiome.
- **Environmental Adaptability**: Adjust scores based on environmental factors; for instance, suggest warmer foods in cold climates.

#### 4. **Algorithmic Recommendations**

Once scores are calculated, the app can rank meals from highest to lowest score, providing personalized meal recommendations. This process ensures that the meals suggested to the user are tailored to their unique needs, preferences, and goals.
