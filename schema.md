To update the schema and handle the various conditions mentioned in your request, here’s a comprehensive list of what needs to be added or modified:

### 1. **Ingredient Portion Sizes per 100 Grams**
   - Add a field for each ingredient to store its **portion size per 100 grams**. This will serve as the base unit of measurement for calculations.
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
         "ingredient": "Chicken Breast",
         "portion_size_per_100g": 100
     }
     ```

### 2. **Ingredient Summation and Adjustment**
   - Create a system to **sum ingredients** based on the portion sizes and user preferences.
   - If an ingredient needs to be **added or removed** (as in receipt calculation adjustments), the system should recalculate the entire meal using the new ingredient list.
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
         "meal_id": 1,
         "ingredients": [
             {"name": "Quinoa", "portion_size_per_100g": 100},
             {"name": "Avocado", "portion_size_per_100g": 50}
         ],
         "total_portion_size": 150
     }
     ```

### 3. **Meal Adjustment Logic**
   - When a user makes a request, the system should first check if there is an **existing meal calculation** (from a receipt, for example).
   - If no existing calculation is found, the system should calculate the meal based on the ingredients provided.
   - If an ingredient is added or removed, the system should adjust the calculation accordingly.
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
         "meal_id": 1,
         "adjustments": {
             "add_ingredient": {"name": "Spinach", "portion_size_per_100g": 30},
             "remove_ingredient": {"name": "Avocado"}
         },
         "recalculated_total_portion_size": 130
     }
     ```

### 4. **User-Specific Nutritional Requirements**
   - Adjust meals and ingredient calculations based on the **user's dietary preferences, allergies, nutritional deficiencies, and health conditions**.
   - The system should ensure that the ingredients match the **user’s preferences** (e.g., avoiding dairy and peanuts) and account for any **nutritional deficiencies** (e.g., adding more Vitamin D and Iron sources).
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
         "name": "Sarah Thompson",
         "nutritional_requirements": {
             "target_vitamin_d": 20,
             "target_iron": 15,
             "dairy_free": true,
             "avoid_allergies": ["Peanuts"]
         }
     }
     ```

### 5. **Meal History and Recent Meals**
   - Use meal history to track what the user has consumed and **avoid duplication** in the upcoming meals.
   - The system should also use the **most recent meal timestamp** to adjust the current meal based on how long ago the last meal was eaten.
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
         "meal_history": [
             {"meal_id": 3, "timestamp": "2024-09-05T12:30:00Z"},
             {"meal_id": 1, "timestamp": "2024-09-07T08:00:00Z"}
         ]
     }
     ```

### 6. **Pre-existing Receipts and Calculations**
   - Add logic for checking if a meal receipt is already **pre-calculated**.
   - If a user submits a pre-calculated meal (from an earlier session), use the **pre-existing calculations** to save processing time.
   - However, if any changes (ingredient additions/removals) are made, the system should **trigger a recalculation**.
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
         "meal_receipt": {
             "meal_id": 1,
             "pre_existing_calculation": true
         }
     }
     ```

### 7. **Meal Request and Preferences Combination**
   - When a user makes a meal request, the system should automatically **combine the request** with the user's preferences and health information.
   - This includes factoring in **preferred cuisines**, **allergies**, **nutritional needs**, and **meal timing**.
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
         "user_request": {
             "meal_time": "Lunch",
             "preferred_cuisine": "Mediterranean"
         },
         "preferences_combined": {
             "avoid_allergies": ["Peanuts"],
             "meal_time": "Lunch",
             "preferred_ingredients": ["Avocado", "Quinoa"]
         }
     }
     ```

### 8. **Nutritional Goal Considerations**
   - The system should account for the user’s **nutritional and health goals** (such as weight loss or energy improvement) in each meal calculation.
   - The system may need to adjust portion sizes or include more or less of specific ingredients based on these goals.
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
         "goals": [
             {"type": "Weight loss", "target_grams": 5000, "duration_days": 90},
             {"type": "Improved energy levels", "target_score": 1.2, "duration_days": 6}
         ],
         "adjustment_based_on_goals": {
             "reduce_calories": true,
             "increase_fiber": true
         }
     }
     ```

### 9. **Environmental and Seasonal Factors**
   - The system should be aware of the **location, climate, and season** to recommend or adjust meals accordingly. For example, different climates may affect hydration needs, and different seasons might dictate ingredient availability.
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
         "environmental_factors": {
             "location": "Urban",
             "climate": "Temperate",
             "season": "Fall"
         },
         "seasonal_adjustments": {
             "increase_root_vegetables": true
         }
     }
     ```

### 10. **Microbiome Data Integration**
   - Include microbiome data to optimize meal recommendations for **gut health**. Recommendations like **increased fiber intake** and **probiotics** should influence the ingredient selection and portion sizes.
   - **Example**:
     ```json
     {
         "microbiome_data": {
             "diversity_score": 7.5,
             "recommendations": [
                 {"action": "increase_fiber", "suggested_ingredients": ["Oats", "Chia Seeds"]},
                 {"action": "increase_probiotics", "suggested_ingredients": ["Yogurt", "Sauerkraut"]}
             ]
         }
     }
     ```
